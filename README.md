BookBot is my first [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project!


# 🤖 BookBot

A lightweight Python CLI app that scans `.txt` books and generates a simple textual report.

It reads a book file, calculates the total number of words, counts the frequency of each character (case-insensitive), and prints a clean, formatted summary to the console.  

Built as a beginner-friendly project to reinforce core programming skills, modular thinking, and working with real-world data using standard libraries.

## 🧠 Python Concepts Practiced

- Reading and parsing text files with `open()` and `.read()`
- String operations: `.split()`, `.lower()`, `.isalpha()`
- Dictionary usage for counting character frequencies
- Creating and sorting lists of dictionaries with `sort()`
- Modular code structure with function decomposition
- Importing custom modules with `from ... import`
- CLI arguments with `sys.argv`
- Basic input validation and error handling with `if` and `sys.exit()`

## ⚙️ Setup

1. Clone the repository.
2. Add a `.txt` book file to the project directory.
3. Run the program via CLI using `python3 main.py book_filepath_here`
4. View the report directly in your terminal.
